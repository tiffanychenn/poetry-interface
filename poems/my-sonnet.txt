i watched an amateur juggler today,
as he hypnotized me and himself with
blue ever-bouncing rubber balls, circling
in and out of vision to entrance us.
the juggler looked around the same age as
Baba, with wrinkles tracing his forehead
from stress, concentration, and memories,
head always down as he laser focused.
Baba would tell me to bounce back, like the
white lacrosse ball he kept from when i was
young and wide-eyed that he would bounce off the
wall to disturb the loud neighbors he loathed.
donâ€™t show emotion, he said, bounce back, and
i learned that was easier said than done.
