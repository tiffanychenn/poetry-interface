## things to split on for sonnets

- Fourteen lines
- (potentially) some kind of rhyme schemes?
- first 8 and last 6
- 4, 4, 4, 2
- 6, 6, 2
- user generated

also with lines short enough, we can definitely just input the lines into DALLE and see what happens

## measures

Aim is having different choices - letting users choose the variations for how these images are generated

Two things: how much text you give it (line by line, stanza by stanza, entire poem) and what kind of text you give it

Types of texts:
- Keywords + emotions: finding keywords and emotions using GPT-3
- Concreteness
  - Concreteness ratings come from [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-022-01912-6) and [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5).
- Imageability
  - Imageability ratings come from [here](https://github.com/mkasu/imageabilitycorpus).
- inputting full line
- frequency of words

## ideas i like but may not actually do

I like this concept of needing two images: what is literally happening and what is metaphorically happening.
