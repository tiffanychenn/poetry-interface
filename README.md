Aim is having different choices - letting users choose the variations for how these images are generated

Two things: how much text you give it (line by line, stanza by stanza, entire poem) and what kind of text you give it

Types of texts:
- Keywords + emotions: finding keywords and emotions using GPT-3
- Concreteness
  - Concreteness ratings come from [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-022-01912-6) and [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5).
- Imageability
- POS parsing / named entities
