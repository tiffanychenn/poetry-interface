# poetry-interface
heehee my new meng project

## fun things about sonnets!

- Fourteen lines, iambic pentameter (assumptions)
- (potentially) some kind of rhyme schemes?
- can separate in stanzas based on rhyme schemes, or first 8 and last 6... can do a lot potentially with not having to automate what exactly we want to illustrate
- metaphors / landscape

also with lines short enough, we can definitely just input the lines into DALLE and see what happens

## measures

Aim is having different choices - letting users choose the variations for how these images are generated

Two things: how much text you give it (line by line, stanza by stanza, entire poem) and what kind of text you give it

Types of texts:
- Keywords + emotions: finding keywords and emotions using GPT-3
- Concreteness
  - Concreteness ratings come from [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-022-01912-6) and [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5).
- Imageability
  - Imageability ratings come from [here](https://github.com/mkasu/imageabilitycorpus).
- POS parsing / named entities
- inputting full line
- frequency of words

I like this concept of needing two images: what is literally happening and what is metaphorically happening.
